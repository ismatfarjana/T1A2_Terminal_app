*💡= idea, 🔵= description,  🍎= reason for not selecting, 🍏= reason for selecting*

#### 💡  BMI(Body Mass Index) calculator 💪
🔵BMI is one type of tool to help health professionals assess the risk for chronic disease by dividing the weight in kg and height in meter squared.

🍎Does not have that much complexity that this project requires. It only takes two integers as input and does a simple calculation and gives regarding information for different weight, mainly a string based app.
#### 💡  Barefoot calculator 💸💰💲
🔵It is a terminal application inspired by the book "The barefoor investor" by Scott Pape.

🍎Does not have that much complexity that this project requires. It only takes one integers as input and does a few simple calculations, sends money management plans, mainly a string based app.

#### 💡  Snake-ladder game :snake: 🎲
🔵 An ancient Indian board game played between two or more players on a gameboard having numbered, gridded squares.

🍎It will require 3 to 4 weeks of time for me to build the complex structure of a snake ladder though I will work on it in as a coding skill practice project.

#### 💡  Sudoku puzzle
🔵A logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle which could be a beautiful project.

🍎Requires lots of time and logical understanding to build it.

#### 💡 Number guessing game 🔢
🔵 A simple number guessing game against computer .

🍎  It was not challaging enough to fulfill the requirements.

#### 💡  Tic-Tac-Toe ✅ **Final project  :rocket:**
🔵 Tic-tac-toe is a game where two players take turns to complete a row, a column, or a diagonal with either three O's or three X's drawn in the spaces of a grid of nine squares; noughts and crosses.

🍏 The time frame and the challange of this seemed perfect if properly done. So I choose this classic game.

###  📜 **About The project 🤔**
---
####  💁🏻 ==What is it❓==

 🗣 A simple terminal interface that will let the user play the classic tic-tac-toe against computer named "Bot".

:::

####  💁🏻 ==What is the purpose of this project❓==

🗣 To give fun experience using the terminal interface while playing the game.
####  💁🏻 ==How it works❓==

🗣 
**User needs to follow the instructions below:**
   ==To start this project ⬇==
* Open terminal on computer. 💻🖥
* The prerequisite of this project is to have `ruby` installed in computer. 
* If `ruby` is not installed go to this link to find instructions of how to install ruby.
 :::info
 🔗 ***LINK FOR RUBY INSTALATION***
https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/?fbclid=IwAR1MkBp39ufIWmZHksBjWN3kCE7aYFI3Z17gBpFNSsbiovHFaV2SwpXj6yY
:::
* Run the file by typing in this pattern `ruby tic_tac_toe.rb <number of rounds>`
* `<number of rounds>` is the number of **total round** user wants to play the game.

* **Users sign ❎** is hard coded for the simplicity of the game. Opponent **Bot** will be holding ⭕ sign.
* User needs to **choose** one number from **1** to **9** and hit **enter** button.
 

####  💁🏻 ==What user is going to experience through the process of the project❓==

🗣
* Hitting the enter button will show a **WELCOME** 💐 message and and the program will ask users **name**.😎

* After entering a number each time, **Bot** will take turn and this circle will go on 🔄 untill the **number of round** is finished.

* After each round name of the **winner** 👑 will be shown.
* After finishing all rounds **Leaderboard** 🏁 will appear which will show if there is a **WINNER** 🎉 or it is a **DRAW** 👻
